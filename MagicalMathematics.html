                <p><b><span id="description">Trick 1:</span></b> I have a deterministic function f that takes a 16-bit string as input and produces a number between 0 and 15 as output. The audience provides a string x and number y. We show that f(z) = y, where z is obtained from x by flipping just one bit.</p>

                <p><b><span id="description">Trick 2:</span></b> A deck of cards is cut several times by the audience and the top 5 cards are removed. Those who have red cards stand up and the cards are determined. We will then discuss how f is designed and how the cards are determined. The first demonstration has connections with error correcting codes, and the second one uses the notion of a de-Bruijn sequence for its mechanics. We will discuss some mainstream applications of these ideas as well.</p><hr>
